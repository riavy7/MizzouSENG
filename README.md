header:The Starter Project

descrition: this project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for primaries,
elections, and various topics. It focuses on the Democratic candidates for the 2016 Presidential Election.
When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the Democratic candidates and uses a data visualization library called
D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidate’s standing in the polls.
