header:The Starter Project

descrition: this project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for primaries,
elections, and various topics. It focuses on the Republican (GOP) candidates for the 2016 Presidential Election.
When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the GOP candidates and uses a data visualization library called
D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidateâ€™s standing in the polls.
